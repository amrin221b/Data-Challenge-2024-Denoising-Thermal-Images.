# Data-Challenge-2024-Denoising-Thermal-Images.

## Repository Introduction

This repository hosts the materials and outcomes of the "Denoising Thermal Images" project, which I did for my M1 curriculum and was presented by Lynred. I have attempt this challenge along with my other three group mates. The primary goal of this challenge was to uncover hidden details in thermal images by applying image correction algorithms. And also using advanced image processing techniques if needed to enhance the quality of thermal imaging data by reducing noise levels.

## Repository Contents
- **Code**: This section contains all the scripts developed for preprocessing, denoising, and analyzing thermal images. These scripts showcase various approaches to handle raw image data, apply Non-Uniform Correction (NUC), and assess the effectiveness of these methods.

- **Report**: A detailed report is included, which outlines the theoretical background, the methodology applied, experimental setup, results, and conclusions. The report also offers insights into the challenges faced during image processing and potential improvements.

## Project Background

The challenge involves working with sequences of raw thermal images affected by a poor signal-to-noise ratio. The task is to apply calibration and correction techniques to enhance image quality, revealing hidden details of a mysterious scene. The dataset includes images at different camera and environmental temperatures, complicating the denoising process.

## Programming Language Used

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, OpenCV)

## Goals

- To develop a reliable method for correcting raw thermal images to enhance their clarity and detail.
- To evaluate different denoising algorithms and their effectiveness in improving the visibility of thermal images.
